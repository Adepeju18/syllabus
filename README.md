This is the syllabus and course material for
[CodeYourFuture](https://codeyourfuture.io/) (CYF),
a not-for-profit volunteer-run coding school for refugees, asylum seekers and disadvantaged groups.

During the course you will learn a technology stack that helps you build
anything from a simple website to a powerful database-driven web application!

The eight-month course contains:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Back-end development using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
- Front-end development using [React](https://reactjs.org/)

We'll complement the course with workshops on modern software methodologies
and job interview practices.

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
