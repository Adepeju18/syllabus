##### GIT & COMMAND LINE V. GITHUB DESKTOP

Discussion around wether to teach GIT & COMMAND LINE (G&CL) or GITHUB DESKTOP (GHD)

- No final decision was made in the meeting about which technology should be taught. 
    - It was agreed that in order to teach anything with Git comprehensively, more teachning time would be needed. Chris said that the 2 hours used to teach the topic could be spread out to 4. 
    - There much discussion about multiple lessons on Git, in order to reduce the cognitive load and increase familiarity for stuents. Chris said that while additional lessons cannot be added, additional reources (as homework etc.) can be included. 
    - Daniel and Ali agreed to work on the Git lesson plan for 31/10/2020.

##### STUDENT FEEDBACK FORM

- Chris has created a Pull Request for a new feedback form to give to students at the end of lessons. 
    - There was consensus that the form was a good idea, and would be added to the syllabus. It is a substantial change because it will affect all lessons. 
    - Ali suggested an additional 'Anything Else?' field to capture intangible feedback, Chris Agreed.
    - Neill pointed out it must be made clear to students who can see their answers and how they will be used, all agreed. 
- ACTION: Chris to check form feedback in 1 month.
