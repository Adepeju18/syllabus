##### GIT & COMMAND LINE V. GITHUB DESKTOP

Discussion around wether to teach GIT & COMMAND LINE (G&CL) or GITHUB DESKTOP (GHD)

- No final decision was made in the meeting about which technology should be taught. 
    - It was agreed that in order to teach anything with Git comprehensively, more teachning time would be needed. Chris said that the 2 hours used to teach the topic could be spread out to 4. 
    - There much discussion about multiple lessons on Git, in order to reduce the cognitive load and increase familiarity for stuents. Chris said that while additional lessons cannot be added, additional reources (as homework etc.) can be included. 
    - Daniel and Ali agreed to work on the Git lesson plan for 31/10/2020.

##### STUDENT FEEDBACK FORM

- Chris has created a Pull Request for a new feedback form to give to students at the end of lessons. 
    - There was consensus that the form was a good idea, and would be added to the syllabus. It is a substantial change because it will affect all lessons. 
    - Ali suggested an additional 'Anything Else?' field to capture intangible feedback, Chris Agreed.
    - Neill pointed out it must be made clear to students who can see their answers and how they will be used, all agreed. 
- ACTION: Chris to check form feedback in 1 month.

### 28/10/2020

#### In Attendance: Ali Smith, Chris Owen, Daniel Wagner-Hall, Tim Hamrouge, Carlos from Migracode

##### CARLOS FROM MIGRACODE

Welcome to Carlos from Migracode who use our syllabus for their course in Spain.

- Carlos answered questions and gave some insight into Migracode.
  - Migracode have been around for 1 year. They were using our syllabus from then to teach with until April when Carlos started updating their syllabus with our new content.
  - Migracode began with one class, then another two in March and started three more in July. The classes consist of ~12 people.
  - The feedback from Spain is that our syllabus is great because of how up to date it is - particularly the content on React hooks. 
  - They have split their classes out into smaller groups to enable them to give students more attention. They also have 1 Spanish class and 1 English class because a lot fo their students are from South America, but they do not translate the syllabus, the teacher does that while teaching. 
  - They offer free English lessons to students. They are able to do this by using trainee teachers who can use the teaching time as credit for their courses. 

##### GIT LESSON

- Chris thanked all those who had worked on the content for the Git lesson.
  - Chris introduced the lesson content to the Birmingham team and it was well received, the lesson will be run by them for the first time on 31/10/20.

##### AOB

- Chris needs some eyes on some PRs. Tim said he would take a look.
- Ali asked for some resources on 'How to ask good questions' and 'How to give good answers'. Ali will write a ticket for this.
