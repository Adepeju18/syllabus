## Coursework Repo

All of the homework for this week can be found in the Node Homework repository [here](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/NodeJS-Homework) under the Week 2 folder

### Submission

You should fork the [NodeJS-Homework](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/NodeJS-Homework) repository, complete all of your work in those folders.

Make sure you create a branch named `[YOUR_NAME]/Week2` to separate your work for each week.

## Prepare a Presentation

Prepare a VERY simple recap of what we did and what we learned in today's class in Node Week 1.

The presentation should last between 60 and 120 seconds

Time yourselves - that is NOT much time!

Next class we will be presenting a few of them in small groups to each other to recap what we learnt.

NOTE: Slides (or presenting from computer) are NOT allowed.

## (Optional) Challenges

You can find additional challenges to work on [here](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/cyf-node-challenges) if you finish all of your homework.
