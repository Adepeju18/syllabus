## Notes

### London (24/06/2020)

- Glitch and Codesandbox had issues
  - Possible non starters.
  - Didn't have reload button (code sandbox).
  - Groups tended to just rely on the one student whose setup was working. or work locally.
- Last exercise needs rework
  - Don't just return the data sent by user
  - "Why would you do this?"
- Breakout room exercises could have been more difficult
