## 5) (Optional) Git Ready

We've only taught you the parts of Git that you need to know right now - if you're feeling ambitious take a look at everything else that Git can do

Important: You don't need to know all of this now! Git is a tool you use to solve your problems - you only need to learn as much you need for now.
