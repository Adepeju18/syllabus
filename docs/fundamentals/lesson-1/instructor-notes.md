## Kahoot

Kahoot is a web app for running quick, fun quizzes with the whole class.

A prepared quiz is [available here](https://play.kahoot.it/v2/?quizId=62bd599b-af55-41c3-b335-c28c9060c023) (editor view [here](https://create.kahoot.it/details/62bd599b-af55-41c3-b335-c28c9060c023)). It is intended to get a general level of confidence in their programming ability from the class. To be able to compare we suggest running it in the first and last classes.

## Slack

Create a private channel for the class and invite the whole class to it.

## Start Code.org homework in class

It is a good idea to spend some time in the class working through the first few lessons. You can help with problems getting signed in, with the interface, etc.
