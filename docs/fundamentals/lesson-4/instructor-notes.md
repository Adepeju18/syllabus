## Shout out questions

See [last lesson's instructor notes](../lesson-2/instructor-notes.md#shout-out-questions)

## Getting unstuck

See [last lesson's instructor notes](../lesson-3/instructor-notes.md#getting-unstuck)

## Live coding

See [last lesson's instructor notes](../lesson-3/instructor-notes.md#live-coding)

## Favourite Khan Academy project presentations

See [last lesson's instructor notes](../lesson-3/instructor-notes.md#favourite-khan-academy-project-presentations)

## Pairing

See [last lesson's instructor notes](../lesson-3/instructor-notes.md#pairing)

We recommend that the students focus on using arrays and objects as they should covered this in the homework. There are some good examples of improvements listed [here](../post-khan-academy-challenges.md). Most of them involve refactoring an existing project to use an array of objects. Note that objects within arrays is challenging for some students so this may need some explanation - perhaps a good live coding topic.

## 1-to-1 assessment

Please read the [1-to-1 assessment goals](../instructor-notes.md#1-to-1-assessments).

This lesson's assessment is quite similar to last lesson's. We recommend focusing on students that most need assessment (i.e. you know less about their level), so that you can make decisions about their progress.

The assessment is also structured a little differently to the previous two, as it can be run as a in-class test as well as a 1-to-1 session. If you have many students that you need to prioritise, then an in-class test may the best choice, however it sometimes can be difficult to make decisions without observation of the student (they could be along the right lines, just missing a crucial detail).

## Kahoot

You can run the [same Kahoot quiz from the first lesson](https://play.kahoot.it/v2/?quizId=62bd599b-af55-41c3-b335-c28c9060c023). It is interesting to compare the results, hopefully the students feel more confident at the end of the course.

## Course reflection

Needs fleshing out.

Look through the concept roadmap and demonstrate the programming principles that they learned.

## Other free resources

Recommend some resources for the students to continue learning. Remember that not all students will continue onto the web development course and so this may be useful for them to keep studying.

The list provided is just a jumping-off point: if you have some recommendations, please add them!

## Migration to p5.js (Optional)

If you have extra time or are keen to continue using concepts from the Khan Academy course, then it recommended to migrate to a different Processing-based JS library [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). The Processing.js library used by Khan Academy is unmaintained whereas p5.js is actively maintained and has an almost identical API.

There are some notes provided about how to migrate the student's projects to p5.js/the OpenProcessing platform. Although the migration workshop is not very fleshed out currently.
