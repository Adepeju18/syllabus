- [Lesson 3](./lesson-3/instructor-notes.md)
- [Lesson 4](./lesson-4/instructor-notes.md)

## Goals

There 2 main goals of this course:

1. Help students with little or no prior programming experience to learn some fundamental concepts of programming
2. Assess the students to help work out if they would struggle on the web development course

## Khan Academy

<!-- TODO: add notes on signing up as a teacher -->

In order to monitor student progress on the course, it is recommended that several teacher and TA volunteers set themselves up a 'class' in KA right at the very start of the module, and then get ALL students to join ALL classes. This gives visibility of the student rota, their exercise progress, and perhaps most importantly, their project attempts.

Student progress often won't be updated on your dashboard until as much as 5-10 minutes have passed

## Assessments

Several assessments have been designed for this module. They should be completed during the in-person class.

### Misc feedback from any volunteer

- Even for small but significant interactions, volunteers should be encouraged to fill out [this feedback form](https://forms.gle/GgpFkgKCRPVtTtrJ7). It's fine to skip bits of it - there's a free text section at the end.
- For form administrators, that's [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13F6J1HiBvmxZy-cSrgDwVxpVAZPdjU3Rv2wsXIpmo_M/edit)

### 1-to-1 assessments

The goal of these assessments is to assess how well the student is progressing. Based on the outcome of the assessment, the instructor(s) can decide whether the student has a good understanding of the subject.

A volunteer should be assigned to sit down with 1 student at a time to "pair" on a small task. It is however not quite like normal pairing: the volunteer should aim to not "give away" the answer. If the student is struggling the volunteer can ask open questions to provide a suggestion.

Note that they are framed as "1-to-1 programming problems" instead of assessments for students so they are less intimidated by them.
