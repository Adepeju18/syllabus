This is the syllabus for Code Your Future's Fundamentals course. During the course you will get a gentle introduction to what programming is, why we want to learn and how to start learning.

[More about this course](about-this-course.md).

The course will last 4 weeks. For each week, there is a web page which you can access on the sidebar to the left.

## Classes

Classes will take place every Saturday/Sunday \(check in your city!\) and will _usually_ start at 11:30am and should finish at around 5:30pm, but look out for time changes in emails and on Slack.

Please arrive on time so that we can finish on time.
