For Final Projects we try to find interesting, tech-for-good projects for that stretch the abilities of those working on them whilst helping an NGO or Charity work towards its goals.

## Past Projects

Here are some of the projects that we've worked on in the past

- [Over The Line with The Compass Collective](https://over-the-line.uk/)

Additionally, here are some examples of internal projects we've completed

- [Class Planner](https://cyf-class-planner.herokuapp.com/)

You can also find more example project briefs on the Project Brief

## Goals

With the final projects, we’re looking to give our students:

- Experience of collaborating in a team to deliver software
- An opportunity to work with real stakeholders and requirements
- The chance to bring together the different things they’ve learned
- A real example to talk about in job interviews and guide their interests

and to give our partners:

- A useful piece of software that they can use as-is or build on after the project

More details can be found on the [Intro](./intro) and [Preparation](./prep) pages.

## What does a Product Owner have to do?

To be a good Stakeholder/Product Owner you should

- Be able to attend a weekly/bi-weekly meeting with our teams
- Be in a position to advise the development of the project
  - e.g. Should we prioritise Feature A or Feature B?
- Have realistic expectations of what our students can build in the time given to them

## What is a Good Project?

It's important that the projects that we work on fulfill some base requirements to make sure they go smoothly.

All Final Projects aim to be a [Minimum Viable Product](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/mvp/). This means they may be rough around the edges but have all of the core functionality working.

### Functionality

A Good Final Project should have the following qualities

1. Be an interactive website

   - This means a website that a user can interact with to create, read, upload, delete data.
   - For example, a photo hosting service or blog would fulfil this criteria
   - A static website like the [CodeYourFuture website](https://www.codeyourfuture.io) would **not**

2. Be completable in four weeks of work

   - This means the website should not be too large that they can't finish it or too small that they complete it too quickly
   - For example, a newsletter sign-up form would be too small
   - For example, a full content management system would be too large

3. Be well-defined

   - This means that from day one our students understand what they are building
   - For example, a well defined project should be able to answer using [User Stories](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories) **all** of the functionality of the project
   - We **can** work with Charities to define projects if they contact us early enough

### Technical Functionality

_Don't know what anything here means? That's fine! The above section covers this in less technical details_

We use the following technologies at CodeYourFuture

- JavaScript
- React
- Node with Express
- MongoDB or PostgreSQL

An external Final Project should use all of these technologies into a single Full Stack package. This is important as we want our students to use all of the skills that they have learnt in our course.

We advise against using other tools as they will fall outside our students areas of competency due to the time constraints that we have.

### Limitations

As Junior Developers, our students do have some limits on what they can produce

- Visual Design Complexity
  - An overly complex design will take a lot longer for our students to develop. Try to keep your designs simple and functional.

## Next Steps

### 1) Complete this form

A good next step to getting started with defining your project is to complete this form.

[CodeYourFuture - Projects Specification Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/1u2zImwEjD5PDWJuMyDeCuQ3AP5xhWr683pGy9HlmC14/edit)

It is important that you answer all of these questions in **as much** details as possible. Even irrelevant details will help us understand what you are trying to achieve.

### 2) Design Mock-Ups

Very quick designs of the tool/website you are trying to build will give us a great insight into what exactly you want built.

You needn't use any specialised tools to design this. Paint or Pen & Paper will do for this step.

Try to think about how each individual page will look. Will the user need to create an account? Think if the form they will need to fill in. Does the user view content on a page? What content should be included?
