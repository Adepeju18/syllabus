For Final Projects we try to find interesting, tech-for-good projects for that stretch the abilities of those working on them whilst helping an NGO or Charity work towards its goals.

## Past Projects

Here are some of the projects that we've worked on in the past

- [Over The Line with The Compass Collective](https://over-the-line.uk/)

Additionally, here are some examples of internal projects we've completed

- [Class Planner](https://cyf-class-planner.herokuapp.com/)

You can also find more example project briefs on the Project Brief

## What is a Good Project?

It's important that the projects that we work on fulfill some base requirements to make sure they go smoothly.

### Functionality

A Good Final Project should have most of the following qualities

1. Be an interactive website

   - This means a website that a user can interact with to create, read, upload, delete data.
   - For example, a photo hosting service or blog would fulfil this criteria
   - A static website like the [CodeYourFuture website](https://www.codeyourfuture.io) would **not**

2. Be completable in four weeks of work

   - This means the website should not be too large that they can't finish it or too small that they complete it too quickly
   - For example, a newsletter sign-up form would be too small
   - For example, a full content management system would be too large

3. Be well-defined

   - This means that from day one our students understand what they are building
   - For example, a well defined project should be able to answer using [User Stories](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories) **all** of the functionality of the project
   - We **can** work with Charities to define projects if they contact us early enough

### Technical Specification

_Don't know what anything here means? That's fine! The above section covers this in less technical details_

We use the following technologies at CodeYourFuture

- JavaScript
- React
- Node with Express
- MongoDB or PostgreSQL

An external Final Project should use all of these technologies into a single Full Stack package. This is important as we want our students to use all of the skills that they have learnt in our course.

We advise against using other tools as they will fall outside our students areas of competency.

## Next Steps

A good first step to getting started with defining your project is to complete this form.

It is important that you answer all of these questions in **as much** details as possible. Even irrelevant details will help us understand what you are trying to achieve.
