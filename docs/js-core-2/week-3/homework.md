## 1) Review Solutions for Last Weeks Coursework

Before starting this week, be sure to review the solutions for last weeks coursework

https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/JavaScript-Core-2-Coursework-Week2-Solution

Make sure you work out what you don't understand and spend some time considering how the code works.

In each of the folders you'll find a `solutions.md` file that will explain more of the solution to you. You should read each of them.

**Note**: This is a private repository. Please speak to your Teacher, Buddy or Class Coordinator to get access. You should ask them to invite your whole class.

## 2) Classwork

Firstly, complete any exercises you did not complete during class. They are essential practice for the rest of the homework tasks.

If you get stuck, reach out to your classmates on Slack for help!
