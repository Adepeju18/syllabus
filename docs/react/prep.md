Before you start React you must make sure that you have some additional software installed.

## Node & NPM

You should already have these tools installed.

To check if Node is installed open `Command Prompt` or `Terminal` or `Git Bash` and type.

```
node -v
```

If this does not work, you should [install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Create React App

Please follow this setup guide to get a new piece of software installed.

[Installing Create React App](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/students/guides/creating-a-react-app)

It is **critical** that this is installed correctly before you arrive at class.

If you have problems installing Create React App then you **must** post on your Slack channel to get help.
