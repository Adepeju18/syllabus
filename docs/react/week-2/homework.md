## Challenges

The key way to get better at React is to build lots of small projects and build up your knowledge. 

You can see a full list of the challenges [here](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/cyf-react-challenges/)

Suitable projects for you to work on right now are:

- [High Score Table](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/cyf-react-challenges/tree/master/challenge-high-score-tables) - All levels
- [Countries](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/cyf-react-challenges/tree/master/challenge-countries) - Level 2 and Higher
- [Baby Names Picker](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/cyf-react-challenges/tree/master/challenge-baby-name-picker) - Level 2 and Higher

You should also choose any of the other projects that sound interesting to you!

## Prepare for the next class

1. Finish reading the official [React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
   - You can ignore anything that uses `Class Components`. This is any code that includes `extends React.Component`
   - This is because we use a slightly newer version of React that uses `Functional Components`
   - You can read [this overview](https://dev.to/danielleye/react-class-component-vs-function-component-with-hooks-13dg) for more details on the differences
2. Read the [lifecycle page](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html) on the official React documentation
3. Read the [AJAX page](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-ajax.html) on the official React documentation
4. Watch [this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxqqrNfgTto) on fetching data in React
